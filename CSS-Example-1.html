             Note that the order in which class names are enumerated below is not significant. 
             What is significant is the order in which the CSS rules are defined in the header.
             Thus the div below has a .5em padding and a 4px thick border of orange colour. The 
             padding and thickness are imposed by the note-box class, whereas the colour by the 
             warning class. The warning class is defined after the note-box class and thus takes 
             precedence. 
        -->
